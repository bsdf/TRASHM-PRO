================= Asm-Pro V1.16g (08-08-2000) =======================

People contributing to this opensource release:
- Aske Simon Christensen aka Blueberry
- Solo

Blueberry:
----------
[FIX]	Pflusha warnings changed from 851/030 only to 851/030+
[FIX]	Nested REPTs work again. It crashed previously.
[FIX]	REPT 0 now skips its contents, instead of crashing.

will change into:
 dc.l "SOLO"


A more extensive example:

checksize:
	moveq   #0,d6
	move    (a3)+,d0
	and     d4,d0
	cmp     #$C057,d0
	beq.b   .wordsize
	cmp     #$C04C,d0
	beq.b   .longsize
	cmp     #$C042,d0
	beq     ERROR_IllegalSize
	bra     HandleMacroos

can be changed into:

checksize:
        moveq   #0,d6
        move    (a3)+,d0
        and     d4,d0
        cmp     #"@W"+$8000,d0
        beq.b   .wordsize
        cmp     #"@L"+$8000,d0
        beq.b   .longsize
        cmp     #"@B"+$8000,d0
        beq     ERROR_IllegalSize
        bra     HandleMacroos

which is a lot more readable..

================= Asm-Pro V1.16f (04-03-2000) =======================
[First OpenSource Release]

Source code of Asm-Pro is now available as OpenSource. Check out the
Website for more details (http://surf.to/asmpro)..

- Fixed autoscroll problem when screensize was bigger than the screenmode size.
- Fixed warning for pmove.l TC,xx

================= Asm-Pro V1.16e (26-12-1999) =======================
[BETA release !!]

This release could be unstable for you but works fine for me most of
the time.. If it is unstabel use v1.16d. I can not give you a newer 
version at this time as I am messing with the source structure and
other things that take more time (and less updates) but will be
significant to future development..

- Removed screen flicker while changing from Data 2 Float regs in 
  debugger window.
- The editor can now handle sources with more than 65535 lines :)
  only 5 digits will show up on screen (99999) but higher linenrs
  will be handled correctly.
  (It sometimes crashes your computer if you swap workspaces and
  debug stuff a lot so I should look at it some more)
- Automatic source backup option added to the env prefs window.
  When this option is switched on, and you make an Update (U) of your
  source, it first renames the old file on disk from "yoursourcename.s"
  to "yoursourcename.s.BACKUP" and then saves the source in the buffer
  to "yoursourcename.s"
  In the future I might add an option to the prefs where you can edit the
  backup extention, maybe even add a time/date or number extention..

================= Asm-Pro V1.16d (21-07-1999) =======================
[BETA release !!]

- Bracket syntax stuff fixed and tested with:

  jsr     ([test])
  jsr     ([test,pc])
  jsr     ([a6])	;executes right but disassembles wrong
  jsr     ([a6,d3])	;executes right but disassembles wrong
  jsr     ([a6,d3*4])	;executes right but disassembles wrong
  jsr     ([4.w,a6])
  jsr     ([4.l,a6,d3])
  jsr     ([4.l,a6,d3*4])

  move.b  ([test],8.w),d2
  move.b  ([test,pc],8.w),d2
  move.b  ([test],d0,8.w),d2
  move.b  ([test,pc],d0,8.w),d2
  move.w  ([4.w,a6,d2*4]),d0
  move.w  ([4.l,a6,d2*4]),d1
  move.w  ([8.w,a6],d3),d2
  move.w  ([8.l,a6],d3,0),d3
  move.w  ([a5,d3*2],4.w),d0	;still wrong

  (Please tell me if you know some more that don't work)

- Fixed small opcode syntax coloring bug..  Comments on a line with no
  opcode and preceding whitespace where colored as if they where
  opcodes :)

- IncLink added. With Inclink you can add linkobjects to the
  current section like this:

  test:
	inclink "ram:testobj.o"

  [Original code for Inclink by deftronic]
  It reads a linkobject file, Relocs it and gets the symbols.  Inclink can
  only handle 1 section per file and it is put in current section.

  These Commands Can be used to make definitions

  - xref   (external reference)  a label you want from the main file
  - xdef
  - globl
  - global
  - extern (external definition) a label you will send to main file

  Use the command write-link (WL) to save a linkfile..


================= Asm-Pro V1.16 (01-04-1999) =======================
[Public release]

- Changed openscreen stuff In Asm-Pro. When screenmode from prefs
  could not be opened a pal/ntsc screen was created.. (not very usefull
  when you have a gfx-card.. so now it opens a screenmode requester..
  (yes yes I noticed it only after I installed my BVision)
- Fixed debug error with instructions like "move.l  #-1,(a1,d1.w*4)"

- "cmp.b  #0,var(pc)" works now.
- "fmove.w #1,fp0" works too.
- Fixed move16 problems in the debugger.
- Also fixed brs.l and bra.l troubles in debugger.
- Fixed fmove.b/w in debugger.

- Changed screenmode stuff to handle more than 4 colors. Now you can
  open screens from 2 to 16 colors (code works for more than 16 colors
  but I dont want to save all of them in the prefsfile).
  (some problems with reqtools showing 2 much colors in prefs though)
- Changed fontrequester from reqtools 2 asl.
  (will remove all the reqtools stuff for future compatibility)
- Added opcode coloring in syntaxprefs.
- The ':' after a label is now also colored :).

================= Asm-Pro V1.15 (05-12-1998) ========================
[Sinterklaas release] :)
[Public release]

- Changed Write block from Amiga-w to Amiga-W.
- Amiga-w is now same as 'U'pdate (more compatible to existing software).
  and also works in the editor (but will end up in command mode will fix
  that later).
- Changed the output of an error in an include file. It now shows the correct
  include file and 3 lines of code, the middle one is highlighted and
  shows the errorline. Then the include line in the current source buffer
  is shown..

Like this:

** Undefined Symbol
In file DH1:ASMPRO/INCLUDE/replay/Player6.1.s
         11 P61_motuuli:
»        12  bra.w P61_Init
         13  ifeq CIA

  144  include replay/Player6.1.s

- Change source in commandline with Function keys implemented.
- D$0100000 works again... bit 24 was cleared iso bit 0... oops..
- Added the commandline options RN and WN.
  RN will open a filerequester for opening a (source) text file with
  no wildcards. should be usefull for editing other text files like
  the startup-sequence..
  WN will do the same for write source and will also not write the
  savemarks on top of the file..
- Recoded the syntax highlighting routine (lot faster) and now it also
  handles labels (maybe more to come).
  (if you use '*-*-*-*' it will not be colored as a comment coz you can
  also do something like this: test = *-2 and then it isn't a comment)
- Fixed bug in changing source buffers when MCP's (060) CopyMemQuick
  patch is activated.
- Masked some more chars in hexdump when 'Ascii only' option is set.
- Added -f (force) option to the AUTO directive. When this option is
  used no more requesters will popup to report you that the
  'File allready exists !! Are you sure ??'. Now it will always
  create/overwrite the file.
  The force option only has to be used once in a source like in the
  example below. It will write Start to End twice without any requesters.

        auto    -f wb ram:test\Start\End\
        auto    wb ram:test\Start\End\

Start:
        dc.b    "Asm-Pro"
End:

- Added Syntax color prefs window.
- Backwards block select will not freeze asmpro anymore. backwards
  selection is not colored anymore though (will fix that later).
- Added Line numbers in the source (by popular demand)..
- Added search option in monitor (so you can search for your
  favourite opcode from inside the monitor ;).
- jmp    ([(label).w,pc,d0.l*4]) works again... (forgot to check for
  the last ']')
- Indices with preceeding 0 do assemble now (e.g. move (a0,d0.w*04),d0)
- Fill is amiga+f, insert is Amiga+i or Amiga+v
- After assembling mem pointer will be set to begin of your program.
- Updated the Asmpro.guide file.

================== Asm-Pro V1.14 (02-09-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- All 10 source buffers have there own read/write directory buffer now
  so loading a source in buffer 1 will not change the path in buffer 0.
- Save marks are now written in ASCII so you can also read your source
  in another editor/txtviewer. The line starts with ";APS" (Asm-Pro
  savemarks)
  The old savemarks are still supported but only when reading a source
  (or includes).
- Ctrl+ESC gets you into the halfscreen editor and scrolling did not work
  propperly anymore but it does now... Halfscreen mode is usefull when
  you need to see the output of a command line option while editing your
  source. (strange nobody ever reported this 2 me).
- Fixed small bug in custom scroll check routine. when CS was selected
  and screensize was changed to something other than 640 Wide CS routine
  was still used (and not working the way it should).
- Added BinMem dump (BM) to the menu.
  (btw you did know about the h.w and m.l memdump stuff changing the
   output on screen to word or longword right?
  >m.w$1200
  00001200 FF60
  )
- Workbench screen is not locked anymore if you select WB2Front.
- Added an option to the Env prefs (Scroll Sync.) to make editor updates
  wait until next frame. This could fix a scroll problem on some Amiga's.
  leave this untoughed if scrolling/editing works fine for you as it slows
  down editor speed somewhat.
- Fixed problems with syntax error highlighting (no more enforcer hits).
- Bra.l will not allow labels in another section anymore.
- Fixed section problem when using brackets, so this works now:

start:
        jsr     ([test])
        rts

	section	another,code	;this was the bottle neck..

test:
        dc.l    go_on

go_on:  nop
	rts



================== Asm-Pro V1.13a (29-07-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- Oops little bug in mark block. Some of the text would dissapear when
  block mark does not start at the beginning of the line.. Fixed now.
  (there are still problems when marking a block backwards though)..


=================== Asm-Pro V1.13 (27-07-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- Fixed problem with BEG> END> when using addresses above $7fffffff
  (like on the BlizzardPPC)
- Cmp2.l assembled wrong fixed now.(oops..)
- After a syntax error asmpro will show you how far the parser got in the
  error line by changing the color of the part that was not parsed yet.
  So the error is right in front of the colored stuff.
  (hmm hope you got that.. anyway make some typo in the source and you'll see)
- Added PCR to the debugwindow (only shown when you have a 060) requested some
  time ago but sliped my mind as I don't have a 060 :)
- Fixed some internal 060 stuff
- BUSCR and PCR  control registers where not known by the disassembler.
- jsr ([label]) and other ([xx,xx],xx,x) stuff works now. Try the next
  source in the debugger:

start:
        lea     0,a0
        lea     test,a1
        moveq.l #1,d0
        moveq.l #0,d1
        jsr     ([test])
        jsr     ([test,a0])
        jsr     ([test,pc])
        jsr     ([test,pc],d0*4)
        jsr     ([test,a0],d0*2,2)
        jsr     ([4,a1],d0*2)
	jsr	([(test).w,pc,d0])
	;ofcoz also other instructions like
	move.w  ([12,a1],d0*2),d1	;-> d1=$00005678
	;etc
        rts

test:
        dc.l    go_on
        dc.l    go_on2
        dc.l    go_on3
	dc.l	value

go_on:  nop
go_on2: nop
go_on3: rts

value:	dc.l	$12345678

- Changed the custom scroll routine and now only works with a screen width of
  640 pixels (well it did only work with 640 screens but now a requester will appear
  telling you so and I removed some obsolete code)..
- Screen size (width and height) is back in the screenmode requester.
- If the include path + filename does not fit on the screen only the last part
  of the string will be shown so you can always see the filename.
  (also applies to incbin,inciff etc.)

Like this:

Include : "ASSEMBLER:ASMPRO/INCLUDE/dos/dos.i        " =      8977 (=$00002311 )
Include : "MBLER:ASMPRO/INCLUDE/libraries/dosextens.i" =       351 (=$0000015F )
Include : "ASSEMBLER:ASMPRO/INCLUDE/dos/dosextens.i  " =     15091 (=$00003AF3 )


=================== Asm-Pro V1.12 (07-06-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- RB <file> could crash your system when no BEG or END was given.
- R <filename> works again.
- The floating point calculator ('[') displays the results correct again.
- cmp2 (dis)assemble correct now.
- Added Custom (cpu) scroll routine to speed up scrolling in the editor.
  Check Env Prefs "Custom Scrollr." to use it.
- Added different date formats to %getdate also one for $VER (dd.mm.yy)..
- Fixed strange memory slider value from startup window in absolute mode
  only noticeable if you had more than 32mb ram.

=================== Asm-Pro V1.11 (19-04-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- Fixed Processor warn and all errors switch. They should work propperly now.
  Processor warn switch was never checked..
- Fixed the click on debug window crash system bug..
- Fixed some small things.
- Fixed scrolling the wrong way when clicking in the source and dragging
  the mouse over the menu strip.
